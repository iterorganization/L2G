# L2G

## Introduction

L2G modules is a suit for running FLT (FieldLine Tracing). It is a library
that gives functionality to prepare FLT cases, run it and post-process it. For
it's kernel it uses the L2G_cpp C++ library, wrapped with Cython. L2G_cpp is a
C++ library that follows magnetic fieldlines in a tokamak. The library solves
the FL equation in a cylindrical coordinate system and for FLT it uses the
Embree3 RT kernel to test if FL intersect any loaded shadowing geometry. It is
equipped with other commonly used functions and classes for inspecting
equilibrium data.

## Installation

To build the module run the following command in a linux systme:

```shell
EMBREE_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/embree L2G_CPP_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/L2G_cpp \
python setup.py build
```

The python package builds on system packages of CentOS 8.x and Debian 11.x.

The development packages of the C++ kernel and Embree are required for
successful compilation.

## Dependencies

In order to see the dependencies, read the requirements.txt file. Build-time
dependencies are:

 - L2G_cpp C++ kernel
 - Embree
 - Cython
 - Numpy

Every other dependency is run-time dependency and not required for building the
package (and it's Cython extension).

# Building documentation

Sphinx is used for building the documentation. Too see which Sphinx extensions
are used check the conf.py file. Otherwise in the doc directory simply run the
make command for either the html or latexpdf format.
