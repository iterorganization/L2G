# L2G

## Introduction

L2G modules is a suit for running FLT (FieldLine Tracing). It is a library
that gives functionality to prepare FLT cases, run it and post-process it. For
it's kernel it uses the YAFLT C++ library, wrapped with Cython. YAFLT is a
C++ library that follows magnetic fieldlines in a tokamak. The library solves
the FL equation in a cylindrical coordinate system and for FLT it uses the
tinybvh RT kernel to test if FL intersect any loaded shadowing geometry. It is
equipped with other commonly used functions and classes for inspecting
equilibrium data.

## Embedded projects

The following projects are embedded and stored in the cpp directory:
 - YAFLT C++ FLT kernel (https://github.com/iterorganization/YAFLT)
    Version: 1.0.1
 - TinyBVH (https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh)
    Version: 1.6.7

## Installation

Installing from source requires installed compilers on Windows or Linux
systems.

Run the following commands from a terminal or cmd.

```shell

# Building documentation

Sphinx is used for building the documentation. Too see which Sphinx extensions
are used check the conf.py file. Otherwise in the doc directory simply run the
make command for either the html or latexpdf format.
