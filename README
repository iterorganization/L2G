# L2G

## Introduction

L2G modules is a suit for running FLT (FieldLine Tracing). It is an application
that gives functionality to prepare FLT cases, run it and post-process it. For
it's kernel it uses the L2G_cpp C++ library, wrapped with Cython. L2G_cpp is a
C++ library that follows magnetic fieldlines in a tokamak. The library solves
the FL equation in a cylindrical coordinate system and for FLT it uses the
Embree3 RT kernel to test if FL intersect any loaded shadowing geometry.

## Installation

The module has been tested and built on MS Windows 10, using Visual Studio 2019
and on linux (CentOS, Debian) using GCC (8.3.0). Before building the module,
you require the dependency L2G_cpp and Embree3 installed.

To invoke the build command on Linux:

```shell
EMBREE_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/embree L2G_CPP_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/L2G_cpp \
python setup.py build
```
In order to build on Windows:

```shell
set EMBREE_ROOT_DIR=c:\path\to\embree
set L2G_CPP_ROOT_DIR=c:\path\to\L2G_cpp
python setup.py build
```
